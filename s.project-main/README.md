# Imported the dataset from kaggle having 4000 images(224X224X3) of masked and unmasked faces with data augmentation
# Ran the test data on basic CNN model using keras layers(Conv2d,MaxPooling2D,Dense,Flatten) with an accuracy of 89%
# Implemented VGG16(all the 16 layers and one dense layer having two nodes) on the test data to achieve accuracy of 54%
# Extracted the pre-trained weights from VGG16 and fed it to the SVM classifier to achieve an accuracy of 97% on the test data
